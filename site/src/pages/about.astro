    <h1>About Claudiobooks</h1>

    <p>
      Claudiobooks takes classic literature from the public domain and transforms it
      into short-form, podcast-friendly audio content. Each audiobook is a carefully
      crafted summary that captures the essence of the original work.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Source:</strong> Books are sourced from
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a>, the oldest
        digital library of free ebooks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Summary:</strong> Each book is summarized by Claude, Anthropic's AI
        assistant, into a 10-20 minute narrative that preserves the story's themes,
        characters, and significance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Narration:</strong> Summaries are narrated using OpenAI's text-to-speech
        technology, creating natural-sounding audio.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why short-form?</h2>
    <p>
      Not everyone has time to listen to a 20-hour audiobook. Claudiobooks gives you
      the key insights and narrative arc of classic literature in the time it takes
      to commute to work or go for a run. Think of it as a well-crafted book club
      discussion, minus the wine.
    </p>

    <h2>Open source</h2>
    <p>
      This project is built in the open. All source material is public domain,
      and the summaries are freely available. The project itself is an experiment
      in AI-assisted content creation.
