Here is something people forget about Dracula. Before it became a Halloween costume, before the movies and the parodies, Bram Stoker's 1897 novel was genuinely terrifying. Not because of fangs and capes, but because of what the vampire represents: something ancient, patient, and intelligent that enters your home, corrupts the people you love, and turns them into something unrecognizable. Dracula is a horror novel, yes. But it is also a story about a group of ordinary people who must find extraordinary courage to fight an evil they can barely comprehend.

The novel is told entirely through documents: journal entries, letters, newspaper clippings, even transcriptions from a phonograph. There is no omniscient narrator. Every piece of the story comes from someone living through it, which means we experience the horror exactly as the characters do, one bewildering fragment at a time.

It begins with Jonathan Harker, a young English solicitor, traveling to Transylvania to help a client purchase property in London. The client is Count Dracula, and the journey east is like traveling backward through time. The locals are terrified when they learn where Harker is going. An old woman at his hotel presses a crucifix into his hands, begging him not to go. "Do you know what day it is?" she asks. "It is the eve of St. George's Day, when the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have full sway."

Harker arrives at Castle Dracula at midnight, of course. The Count greets him at the door with unsettling courtesy: "Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!" He is tall, clean-shaven, dressed in black from head to foot. His handshake is ice cold. His teeth are peculiarly sharp. When Harker cuts himself shaving the next morning, the Count lunges for his throat with what Harker describes as demoniac fury, only stopping when his hand touches the crucifix around Harker's neck.

The days that follow are a slow descent into nightmare. Harker realizes there are no servants. He realizes the doors are locked. He realizes the Count casts no reflection. And then, late one night, leaning from a window, Harker sees something that shatters his understanding of the world: "I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down, with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings." The Count moves like a lizard, fingers and toes gripping the stone. Harker writes in his journal: "What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man?"

There is worse to come. Exploring a forbidden wing of the castle, Harker is visited by three beautiful vampire women with brilliant white teeth and ruby lips. One bends over him and he feels a shivering anticipation. Dracula bursts in and drives them back: "How dare you touch him, any of you? This man belongs to me!" He throws them a bag containing something alive, and Harker hears a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child.

Harker is a prisoner. He knows he will die in this castle unless he can escape.

The story then shifts to England, to Mina Murray, Harker's fiancee, and her beautiful friend Lucy Westenra. Lucy is so lovely that three men propose to her on the same day: Dr. John Seward, who runs a lunatic asylum; Arthur Holmwood, a young lord; and Quincey Morris, a brave Texan adventurer. She accepts Arthur but feels terrible about disappointing the others.

Meanwhile, a Russian ship called the Demeter crashes into the harbor at Whitby during a tremendous storm. Every sailor aboard is dead. The captain is lashed to the wheel, a crucifix bound in his hands. His log tells of crew members vanishing one by one during the voyage, of a tall, thin, ghastly pale figure seen moving about the ship at night. The mate tried to stab it, but the knife went through it, empty as the air. The cargo: fifty boxes of earth shipped from Transylvania.

An immense black dog leaps from the wreck and disappears into the night. Dracula has arrived in England.

Lucy begins to change. She sleepwalks. She grows pale and weak. Two small puncture wounds appear on her throat. Dr. Seward, baffled, summons his old teacher, Professor Abraham Van Helsing, from Amsterdam. Van Helsing is the intellectual heart of the novel: brilliant, eccentric, passionate, and one of the few people alive who understands what they are dealing with.

He arranges blood transfusions from all three of Lucy's suitors and from himself, but nothing stops her decline. He garlands her room with garlic flowers, which holds the vampire at bay. But Lucy's mother, ignorant of the danger, removes the garlic one night because she finds the smell unpleasant. It is a small, domestic, heartbreaking moment, and it seals Lucy's fate.

Lucy dies. But her death is only the beginning of her horror.

---

Soon after, children in the neighborhood begin going missing at night, returning with bite marks on their throats. They speak of a "Bloofer Lady," a beautiful woman who lures them away. Van Helsing knows the truth. He takes the three men who loved Lucy to her tomb.

The coffin is empty.

They wait in the graveyard until they see a white figure gliding between the tombstones, carrying a child pressed to her breast. It is Lucy, but not the Lucy they knew. The sweetness has turned to heartless cruelty, the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Her lips are crimson with fresh blood. She sees Arthur and speaks in a voice that is both seductive and terrible: "Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry for you."

Van Helsing forces her back with a crucifix. The next night, he explains what must be done. Arthur, the man who loved her most, must drive the stake through her heart. He takes the stake and hammer. Van Helsing reads the prayer for the dead. Arthur places the point over her heart, and he strikes with all his might.

The thing in the coffin writhes and shrieks, a hideous blood-curdling screech that fills the vault. The body shakes and twists in wild contortions. But Arthur does not stop. When it is over, they look into the coffin and see not the foul thing, but Lucy as she was in life, her face restored to sweetness and peace.

"She is God's true dead," Van Helsing says, "whose soul is with Him."

With Lucy avenged, the group turns to the real enemy. Van Helsing assembles a hunting party: himself, Dr. Seward, Arthur, Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker who has escaped from Castle Dracula and married Mina, and Mina herself, who proves indispensable as the organizer and analyst of all their collected documents.

Van Helsing explains the nature of their opponent. Dracula can transform into a wolf, a bat, or a mist. He has the strength of twenty men. He can control weather and command rats, owls, and wolves. He can only be killed by a stake through the heart, decapitation, or exposure to sunlight. And he must rest during the day in consecrated earth from his homeland, which is why he shipped fifty boxes of Transylvanian soil to England.

The group's strategy is clear: find and destroy the boxes of earth, cutting off Dracula's refuges one by one. They track them across London, breaking into properties, opening crates, and placing sacred wafers inside to render them useless. It is dangerous, methodical work, and they are racing against an enemy who knows they are coming.

---

Then Dracula strikes back, and he strikes at the heart of the group.

He attacks Mina. The men burst into the Harkers' bedroom to find Jonathan in a stupor and Mina kneeling on the bed, her face forced against Dracula's bare chest. He has opened a vein and is forcing her to drink his blood, creating a bond between them. The image Stoker uses is deliberately obscene: "The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink."

Dracula flees as mist. Mina, sobbing, tells them what happened. She cries: "Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more." When Van Helsing tries to bless her forehead with the Sacred Wafer, it burns her skin, leaving a red scar. The mark of the vampire's corruption is upon her.

But this attack, meant to break them, instead gives them a weapon. The psychic link between Mina and Dracula works both ways. Under hypnosis, Mina can sense where Dracula is. They use this connection to track him as he flees England, racing back to Transylvania in his last remaining box of earth.

---

The final chase is a desperate race against time. The group pursues Dracula across Europe by train, carriage, and boat. Van Helsing takes Mina ahead to Castle Dracula itself, where he finds the three vampire women who once tormented Harker. He destroys them, and the ancient castle falls silent at last.

The others converge on a band of gypsies transporting Dracula's earth-box by wagon up a mountain road. The sun is setting, and when darkness falls, Dracula will awaken at full power. Jonathan and Quincey Morris force their way through the armed escort. Quincey is stabbed in the side, blood pouring through his fingers, but he does not stop.

They wrench open the box. Inside lies the Count, deathly pale, his red eyes glaring with vindictive hatred. He sees the sinking sun and his expression turns to triumph. He believes he has won.

But Jonathan's knife flashes and shears through the Count's throat. At the same instant, Quincey's bowie knife plunges into the heart. And before their eyes, the whole body crumbles into dust and passes from sight. In that last moment, there is a look of peace on the face, such as none of them could have imagined resting there.

Quincey Morris dies from his wounds, but not before seeing that the red scar has vanished from Mina's forehead. "The curse has passed away," he whispers. He dies with a smile, a gallant gentleman.

Dracula endures because Stoker understood something fundamental about fear. The novel is not really about a monster with fangs. It is about violation: of the body, of the home, of the people we love. It is about watching someone you cherish become something terrible, and finding the courage to do what must be done even when it breaks your heart.

The vampire hunters are not superheroes. They are a professor, a doctor, a lawyer, a lord, and a Texan. They are terrified, heartbroken, and often outmatched. What carries them through is loyalty, love, and the stubborn refusal to let evil win.

Seven years after the events of the novel, Jonathan and Mina Harker have a son. They name him Quincey, after the friend who gave his life so theirs could continue. It is a quiet ending for such a violent story, and perhaps the most human moment in the entire book. Evil can be defeated, Stoker tells us. But it costs something. It always costs something.

This has been Dracula by Bram Stoker.
